VGG11 has been implemented using keras for Digit(0-9) classification.

Dataset - MNIST from keras

The model has ben implemented using the structure and parameters mentioned in the paper- 
VERY DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS FOR LARGE-SCALE IMAGE RECOGNITION( Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2015 )
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf
-Karen et. al.

The model performance is also checked by introducing regularisation and data augmentation.

Using library pillow, images have been reshaped from 28*28 to 32*32.
Images have been resized because there are 5 maxpool layers with pool size of (2,2). Using input image of 32*32 we will get image of 1*1 after application of max pool layers.
If we would have used 28*28 image we would have got error.

Test images are rotated from -45 degrees to 45 degrees and also gaussian blurred having radiuses 0 to 6.
Model performance is checked in 3 scenarios( Neither regularisation nor data augmentation, Regularisation, Data Augmentation ).
The performance is visualised using plots.

Data Augmentaion has been implemented in vgg11_mnist_regularisation python notebook/file.
